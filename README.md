Creating a simple calculator using C programming on an AVR microcontroller is a fantastic project to enhance your embedded systems skills. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how you can approach this project:

Project Description
Objective: Develop a basic calculator that performs simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using an AVR microcontroller.

Features
User Interface:
Use a 4x4 keypad for input.
Display results on a 16x2 LCD.
Functionalities:
Read inputs from the keypad.
Perform arithmetic operations.
Provide handling signed number.
Display the result on the LCD.
Error Handling:
Handle division by zero.
Validate inputs to ensure they are numbers.

Steps to Implement
Set Up the Environment:
Install Eclipse IDE.
Set up the AVR-GCC toolchain.
Design the Circuit:
Connect the keypad and LCD to the AVR microcontroller (e.g., ATmega32).
Write the Code:
Initialize the LCD and keypad.
Write functions for each arithmetic operation.
Implement the main loop to read inputs, perform calculations, and display results.
